# Movie Data
For this project, I built a user interface, using HTML, and populate that with data from a JavaScript object.
During the work on this project, I learned:
1. Render the data onto the webpage with DOM Manipulation.
2. Allow the user to affect the display of the data by interacting with the webpage.
3. Basics about an HTML form to collect user input.
4. How to use a window onload event to launch certain functions whenever a web page is loaded.

## Things to improve:
1. Add the form validation and style the form.
2. Make the webpage responsive.
3. Allow the user to add/remove the data in the object by using the form. Now the form allows only display the added movies without saving them in movieData.
